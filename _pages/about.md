<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am broadly interested in *efficient computer vision and machine learning*, with a primary goal of reducing the enormous training costs associated with deep neural networks. More specifically, my research is dedicated to designing highly efficient algorithms that enable machine learning models to achieve near-optimal performance using only a small amount of data. Currently, I focus on *dataset distillation and coreset selection*, exploring both matching-based methods, generative model-based approaches and optimization-free methods. I am also interested in exploring its potential applicability beyond the image classification, particularly in addressing more complex computer vision tasks, such as image restoration, detection, and so on.
